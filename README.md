# Clever-client-Bot

## **Overview**
Clever-client-Bot is a basic reboot of the original Cleverbot client developed by Rodney Folz - [Cleverbot.py](http://github.com/folz/cleverbot.py).

This library has been developed as a more cut down and simpler version of the original library, there is a new coding style and the methods used to communicate with the server has been re-arranged to a visually ease-of-use style.

## *Issues*
Please post any issues in the issues section here on GitHub if you encounter anything abnormal.

Some known issues include:
    * The connection might receive a 400 BAD REQUEST, time to time,
    * The data being sent should really be cleared out, rather than piling it (this is a todo),
    * Needs to be able to log using logging module (another todo).
